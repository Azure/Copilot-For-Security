# Security Copilot-isUserTravel
Author: Yaniv Shasha





Activating the 'Deploy' button initiates the deployment of an Azure Logic App integrated with Security Copilot Actions, utilizing a Microsoft Sentinel incident trigger.
The Logic App is configured to run when a new incident is created in Sentinel. This Logic App works best on the following incident types:<br>

- **Suspicious behavior: Activity from infrequent country or region** </br>
- **Suspicious behavior: Impossible travel activity** </br>

After Copilot conducts an investigation, it identifies the user's manager (from the Sentinel UEBA table) and sends them an email with a question about the user's travel status. If the manager responds with a "yes," we are likely dealing with a false positive. Therefore, Copilot adds the manager's answer to its context and writes a report that includes it.</br>
If the manager responds that the user is not traveling, the investigation continues, focusing on identity prompts.</br>
