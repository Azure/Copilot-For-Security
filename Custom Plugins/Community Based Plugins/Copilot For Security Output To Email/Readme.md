# Microsoft Copilot for Security Custom Plugins - Send COpilot Output to Email 

# Send Copilot Output to Email Plugin

## Overview

The "Send Copilot Output to Email" plugin is designed to seamlessly integrate with Microsoft Copilot for Security. Its primary purpose is to take an output generated by Copilot and send it to a designated email address. This plugin enhances the flexibility of Copilot by allowing users to receive important security alerts and notifications directly in their email inbox.

## Solution Components

The plugin solution consists of the following components:

1. **YAML File**: Contains the configuration settings required for the plugin to function properly. Users need to modify this file to specify the email address where the Copilot output should be sent.

2. **Logic App**: This Logic App is responsible for triggering the email sending process based on the Copilot output. It listens for incoming data from Copilot and then processes it to send an email to the specified recipient.

## Deployment

To deploy the "Send Copilot Output to Email" plugin, follow these steps:

1. **Modify YAML Configuration**: Update the YAML file included in the solution with the appropriate email address where you want the Copilot output to be sent.

2. **Deploy Logic App**: Deploy the Logic App included in the solution to your Azure environment. Ensure that it is properly configured and connected to Copilot.

4. **Add Plugin to Copilot**: Once the Logic App is deployed and configured, add the "Send Copilot Output to Email" plugin to your Copilot instance. Provide any necessary authorization or connection details required for the plugin to communicate with Copilot and trigger the email sending process.

5. **Test**: Test the plugin by generating sample output from Copilot and verifying that the email is sent to the designated address.

## Usage

After deploying and configuring the plugin, Copilot will automatically send the output to the designated email address whenever relevant security events occur. Users can monitor their email inbox for important notifications and take appropriate actions based on the information provided.
