            To 'defang' a URL means to change the scheme to either hxxp or hxxps and replace '.' with '[.]' in the domain so that the URL is still easily readable by a human but doesn't automatically render as a hyperlink if rendered in a rich client such as Outlook. This is often done when sharing potentially malicious links to prevent the reader accidentally clicking on them and visiting a malicious website.

            Some examples of defanging URLs:
            1. https://example.com --> hxxps://example[.]com
            2. http://subdomain.example.com/path.with.dots/ --> hxxp://subdomain[.]example[.]com/path.with.dots/

            Defang any URLs in the following text and return the new text:
            {{text}}
