            summary: Gets a list of all recommendations made available by the "SOC Optimization" experience in Microsoft Sentinel.

                There are two types of recommendations.

                The recommedations of type "Precision_Coverage" are focused on the improvement of the coverage on threat detection against a 
                specific threat or attack. The coverage refers to the quantity of defenses established in Sentinel to counteract that threat.
                These defenses are usually artifacts, such as analytic rules, threat hunting queries, notebooks, workbooks, and so on, 
                which can be identified as "solutions" in the Sentinel's Content Hub or can be created as custom solutions. 
                The possibility to install and use these solutions depends on the availability of the data sources they refer to.
                
                The recommedations categorized as "Precision_DataValue" are aimed at enhancing the utilization of data that has been 
                ingested into a particular table in the Log Analytics workspace, which serves as storage for the Sentinel workspace.

                For each of the returned recommendations, the response include its type and a set of suggestions. Each suggestion related to 
                a specific recommendation may include "additional properties". The list of these properties depends on the type of the 
                related parent recommendation.

                Suggestions related to recommendations of type "Precision_Coverage" inlude 
                
                    the list of "TemplateIds" (IDs of the artifacts that can be found in the Microsoft Sentinel Content Hub and that, if adopted, 
                    could help for improving the coverage against the considered threat), 
                    
                    the list of "Tactics" (including the MITRE ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques involved in the threat considered by the analyzed coverage), 
                    
                    the list of "CoverageEntities" (including a list of artifacts, which are Templates in the Content Hub in Sentinel, - described in 
                    terms of Identifier Id and Name plus MITRE ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques), 
                    
                    the list of "DataSources" (representing the names of the tables in Log Analytics that inlcude data that may be useful to improve 
                    the coverage) 
                    
                    and the list of "ConnectorIds" (representing the names of the connectors that can be found in the Content Hub in Sentinel and 
                    that, if activated, could ingest data that may be useful to improve that coverage)
                
                Suggestions related to recommendations of type "Precision_DataValue" inlude the list of of "TemplateIds" (IDs of the solutions, that  
                can be found in the Microsoft Sentinel Content Hub, containing artifacts that can use the data collected in the considered table)

    /contentPackages?api-version=2024-01-01-preview:
        get: 
            operationId: GetSentinelContentHubInstalledPackages
            summary: Gets a list of all the "packages" (a.k.a. "solutions") available in the Content Hub in Microsoft Sentinel
                and already installed in the referenced Sentinel workspace.

                The result for each package includes a list of "dependecies" which are basically the artifacts included in the 
                solution (analytic rules, threat hunting queries, notebooks, workbooks,...)

            responses:
                200:
