# Copilot for Security Custom Plugin - SOC Optimization in Sentinel

SOC Optimization is a feature of Microsoft Sentinel that provides the recommendations for optimal data utilization and attack detection.
This custom plugin connects to Azure REST APIs to get the details of all the recommendations delivered by SOC Optimization.

### Prerequisites:
* This plugin is useful when you have a Microsoft Sentinel workspace

### Note: 
The code in this custom plugin is also an example on how to query, from Copilot for Security, any Azure REST API. Implement the same strategy to develop custom plugins that gather comprehensive information about any Azure component (like Log Analytics, VMs, etc.) that you think would be beneficial for your Copilot for Security users in their investigations and promptbooks. 

### Instructions: 
1. Download the "manfiest" YAML file in this folder. Save it locally
3. Add the custom plugin in Copilot for Security by uploading the manfiest YAML file (see [Manage plugins in Microsoft Copilot for Security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/security/manage-plugins?tabs=securitycopilotplugin))
