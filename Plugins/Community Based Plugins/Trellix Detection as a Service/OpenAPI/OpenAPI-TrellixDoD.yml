    FireEye offers a best-in-class virtual execution engine in many of its core products, including our Network Security, Email Security, and File Analysis solutions. Now our customers can interact with and consume those capabilities directly via a scalable and performant web service. Use the new RESTful API to submit files for malware analysis, search hash values for past analysis results, get full reports for your file submissions, and integrate into your existing toolsets and workflows.
