    title: GitHub Advanced Security Code Scanning for GitHub Repositories
    description: Skills to retrieve code scanning default settings and code scanning alerts for the default branch of a specific GitHub repository (repo). 
        These code scannings are executed by GitHub Advanced Security (GhAS).
    version: "0.0.1"

paths:
    /{repo}/code-scanning/alerts:
        get: 
            operationId: ListCodeScanningAlertsForARepository
            summary: Lists the alerts produced as result of the code scanning executed by GitHub Advanced Security (GhAS) 
                Each alert is related to a specific code vulnerability found in one or more files in the repo.
                In each alert listed in the response, the field named "tool" contains the name of the code scanning tool that raised the alert.
                The field "most_recent_instance" contains the location (path, start line & column, end line & column) of the most recent instance of this alert in the default branch.
                The field "rule" contains the logic that found the code vulnerability and triggered the alert; the most relevant attributes for this rule are its "description" and its "severity".
