5. To the extent the plugins include the use of artificial intelligence technology, you must implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure such artificial intelligence technology complies with all laws and industry standards, including standards and policies related to the ethical or responsible use of artificial intelligence technology.
