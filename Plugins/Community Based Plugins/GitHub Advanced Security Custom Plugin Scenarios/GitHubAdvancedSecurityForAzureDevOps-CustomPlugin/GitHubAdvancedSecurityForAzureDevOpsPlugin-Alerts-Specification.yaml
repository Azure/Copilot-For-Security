    title: GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps - Alerts API
    description: Skills to retrieve Code Scanning, Dependabot Scanning and Secret Scanning alerts for the default (main) branch of
        the repositories (repos) of the projects stored in a specified Azure DevOps organization. 
        These scannings are executed by GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps (a.k.a. GAzDO). 
        IMPORTANT NOTICE 
        Despite its name suggesting a destination of use on a GitHub DevOps environment, GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps is a 
        security solution that operates solely within Azure DevOps environments. It does not analyze code stored in GitHub repositories. 
        The solution for GitHub repositories is called “GitHub Advanced Security” or GhAS. 
        DO NOT CONSIDER THE SKILLS DESCRIBED IN THIS GROUP FOR PROMPTS RELATED TO GitHub REPOS.
        GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps conducts secret scanning, dependency scanning (Dependabot, SCA), and code scanning 
        (via CodeQL, a SAST solution) in the Azure DevOps repositories where it is activated.
