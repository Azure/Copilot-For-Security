    description: Skills to retrieve the status of "enablement" for GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps (GAzDO) at repositories (repos), 
        projects and organization level. In details, the skill returns the status of enablement of Code Scanning, Dependabot Scanning and 
        Secret Scanning in Azure DevOps (features of GAzDO).
        An additional specific "usage" skill in this same group allow to count how many "active committers" (active Azure DevOps users) 
        has the organization.
        For the projects and repos where the GAzDO's features are not enabled, the "estimation" skills in this same group allow to estimate 
        the number of active committers that would be added to the customer's usage if Advanced Security was enabled on those projects and repos.
        IMPORTANT NOTICE 
        Despite its name suggesting a destination of use on a GitHub DevOps environment, GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps is a 
        security solution that operates solely within Azure DevOps environments. It does not analyze code stored in GitHub repositories. 
        The solution for GitHub repositories is called “GitHub Advanced Security” or GhAS. 
        DO NOT CONSIDER THE SKILLS DESCRIBED IN THIS GROUP FOR PROMPTS RELATED TO GitHub REPOS.
        GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps conducts secret scanning, dependency scanning (Dependabot, SCA), and code scanning 
        (via CodeQL, a SAST solution) in the Azure DevOps repositories where it is activated.
