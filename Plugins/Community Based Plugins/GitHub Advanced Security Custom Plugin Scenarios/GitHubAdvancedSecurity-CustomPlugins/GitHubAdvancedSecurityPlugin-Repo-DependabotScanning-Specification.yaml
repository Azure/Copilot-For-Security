            summary: Lists the alerts produced as result of the dependabot scanning executed by GitHub Advanced Security (GhAS).

                The field "value" with type "CVE" under "identifiers" gives the CVE name of the vulnerability found in the affected  software component.
                The field named "references" include the links to all relevant official resources describing the vulnerability.
                The fields named "vulnerable_version_range" and "first_patched_version" describe the versions that are vulnerable and the one where the vulnerability has been removed.
