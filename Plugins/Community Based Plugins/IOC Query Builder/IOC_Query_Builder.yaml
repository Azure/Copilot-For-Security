            When a security operations analyst recieves a list of indicators of compromise (IOCs), they will search their SIEM tool to identify if a system may have been infiltrated by a cyber threat. The list of IOCs will need to be formatted in such as way that it can be included in a KQL query.

            Some examples of this formatting in KQL:
            1. microsoft.com securitycopilot.microsoft.com security.microsoft.com --> 'microsoft.com','securitycopilot.microsoft.com','security.microsoft.com'
            2. 1.1.1.1 8.8.8.8 --> '1.1.1.1','8.8.8.8'

            Format any IOCs in the following text and return the new text:
            {{iocs}}
