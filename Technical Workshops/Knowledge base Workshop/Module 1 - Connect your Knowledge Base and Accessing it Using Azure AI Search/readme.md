## 3. Creating a Blob Container:
- Creating a container within your storage account to organize your blobs.
- Configuring container properties such as access level and metadata.
- Reference: ![Create Blob Container](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/media/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal/create-blob-container.png)

## 4. Uploading and Managing Blobs:
- Uploading files and data to your blob container using the Azure Portal.
- Viewing and managing blobs within your container, including properties and metadata.
