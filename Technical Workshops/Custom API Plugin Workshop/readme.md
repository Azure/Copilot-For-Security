### Objectives

This folder contains a set of plugins to send data via GET (with and without parameters) and POST (parameters sent using JSON). The plugins make REST calls to a Python/Flask based website which is available in the folder FlaskWebsite. The objective of the plugins YAML files and the Flask website is to show how you can make a call to specific REST API, along with making the correct prompts so that Copilot for Security planner/orchestrator selects your plugin and makes the REST call. Since the calls are made to a custom webserice you can see the what type of data exchange takes place between the Copilot for Security and your WebService.
