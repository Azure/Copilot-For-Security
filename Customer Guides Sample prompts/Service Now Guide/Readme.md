### Microsoft Security Copilot Plugin Guide â€“ ServiceNow  

## Plugin overview 

ServiceNow is an enterprise app ecosystem designed to connect and automate business processes, delivered as a SaaS application. Many security operation centers (SOCs) use ServiceNow as part of their incident management flow, and often extend the core functionality with customizations, integrations, and security-specific modules. 

The Security Copilot plugin for ServiceNow enables connectivity between a Security Copilot session and a ServiceNow incident queue. Users can import a ServiceNow incident into Security Copilot, easily correlate with data from Microsoft security products such as Defender for Endpoint, enrich with external threat intelligence, and persist the results of their investigation in ServiceNow. These capabilities, combined with the narrative prompt and generative AI powered by Azure OpenAI, speed incident resolution, help up-skill team members, and provide more comprehensive views into any security incident.
