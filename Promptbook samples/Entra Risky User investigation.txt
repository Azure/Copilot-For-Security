Generate an executive report summarizing insights on a potentially risky user. Commence with metadata details for the user, encompassing their User Principal Name (UPN), suspected country of origin, configured authentication method, and any recorded failed login attempts. Follow this with a bullet-point list outlining key areas requiring remediation to address the identified risks. Subsequently, craft a coherent paragraph elucidating mitigation strategies aimed at ameliorating the highlighted concerns
