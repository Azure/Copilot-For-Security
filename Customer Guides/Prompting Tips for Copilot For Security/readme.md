# Prompting Tips with  Microsoft Copilot for Security 

| Best Practice                                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| **State your Goal**                                   | What are you hoping to achieve out your inquiry (prompt)? Make Copilot aware of your intended goal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Provide Context & Set Expectations**                | Be specific and provide context when asking questions, such as the name of the plugin, skill, or the promptbook you’d like to use. Be mindful of the words you use in your prompts and how they may affect the chatbot's response. Words matter and they can influence the selection of skills. Include modifiers such as format, audience, length, and confidence to guide the model and avoid ambiguity. |
| **Provide the Source**                                | State the source of the information you seek in your prompt, especially if there are multiple sources which could extract similar information.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Continue to Iterate**                               | Iterate and refine your prompts if you don't get the expected results. Use different words or phrases to ask the same question if you don't get the desired result the first time. The chatbot may recognize synonyms or alternative expressions better.                                                            |
| **Be Positive and Respectful**                        | Use positive instructions instead of negative ones. Be respectful and appropriate for the workplace and avoid any biased, inappropriate, or violent content. Use the singular "they" pronoun to refer to people and avoid guessing their gender, roles, or feelings.                                                 |
| **Treat Copilot as your Compadre**                    | Address Copilot as "you" instead of "model" or "assistant".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Treat new Copilot sessions as if they are a Stranger** | Sessions currently cannot reference other sessions. Meaning, if you ask a question in relation to an answer provided in a previous session, your new Copilot struggle will likely struggle to address without enough context. Please be mindful of this working with Copilot.                                       |
| **Make Copilot do the Heavy Lifting when it comes to summarizing your sessions** | Concluding your session, leverage Copilot for Security to summarize the prompts’ responses for whatever audience you choose.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Bridge your KQL knowledge gap with NL2KQL skills and KQL custom plugins**     | Use the natural language to KQL (NL2KQL) plugin to hunt for information in your data sources using plain English. Junior KQL users will appreciate our KQL custom plugins to execute common KQL queries via natural language.                                                                                        |
| **Automate wherever possible**                        | Use promptbooks and custom promptbooks to automate common security workflows, which require iterative responses to collate and summarize the information you seek.                                                                                                                                                  |
| **It's okay to experiment. In fact, it’s encouraged!** | We’re venturing unchartered territory as a market with Security LLMs. Don’t be afraid to experiment with different ways of framing your prompts and evaluate the results based on your needs and expectations. You may be pleasantly surprised to find new things you never thought possible. Share your learnings with us in the comments of our blog. |
