# Sample Prompts Library 

Welcome to our page of sample prompts! Here, we offer a variety of examples to demonstrate how prompts can be used to achieve different security tasks. Our examples showcase how specific prompts can be utilized to perform a range of tasks. This is a collaborative page where people can learn from the examples and contribute their own.


We have organized our examples into the following categories:



  - [External Attack (EASM)](./EASM/Easm.md)
  - [Entra](./Entra/Entra.md)
  - [Intune](./Intune/Intune.md)
  - [Defender \& Sentinel](./Defender%20and%20Sentinel/Defender%20and%20Sentinel.md)
  - [Threat Intelligence (MDTI)](./MDTI/MDTI.md)
  - [Vulnerabilities](./Vulnerabilities/Vulnerabilities.md)
