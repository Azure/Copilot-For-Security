####  Use case


As a SOC Analyst at Woodgrove Domain, you are involved in investigating an SAP incident. During this investigation, you identified a user engaging in suspicious activity, specifically downloading a file from the SAP system. To respond swiftly, it's crucial to rapidly enrich this user's profile with data from your HR system, known as **WoodgroveHR**.<br> 

Given that this incident occurred in an air-gapped environment, your colleague from Woodgrove-airgap has provided the incident details in a Json format, which you need to access and utilize for further analysis.<br> 


**Your task is:**<br>

1. Fetch air-gapped sentinel incident into Copilot Session memory. 
> ‚≠ê Notice: <br>

To use the FetchURL option, the Public **Web plugin** must be enabled
