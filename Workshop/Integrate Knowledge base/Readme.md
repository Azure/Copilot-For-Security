## Introduction

Our lab initiatives are tailored to expedite your acclimatization to Microsoft Copilot for Security. They provide immersive, hands-on experiences, empowering you to seamlessly connect with your knowledge base.

## Connect your Org Knowledge Base

**Microsoft Copilot for Security** allows you to integrate your organization’s knowledge base as an additional source of information. The inclusion of knowledge bases gives **Copilot** more context, resulting in responses that are more relevant, specific, and customized to the user.

**Benefits of connecting a knowledge base**

Knowledge bases could be any repository of an organization’s proprietary information, like wikis, policy and compliance documents, report templates, investigation and response procedures, historical data, and KQL libraries, or even public repositories like Microsoft Learn documentation, prescriptive guidelines, and frameworks.
